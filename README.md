# Calculating-Temperature
This code takes temperature in input of celsius and converts it into degrees


This app needs code to resume when pressing yes. when you press yes (y), the app closes out. Its suppose to restart and ask for you to enter a number to convert to Fahrenheit but it does not. I would like to make the applicatiion as refined as possible even htought it only does one task. Lets create more tasks with it.
